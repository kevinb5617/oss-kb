> Q3: Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
* Generally, the licenses that are used when distributing software dictate that the software is "free", with the four criteria [here](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html). However, not all software is always "free". In particular the one criterion about redistribution is usually not part of educational software, like PyCharm. The ability to run the software is usally given to one "account" or person to prevent unaccounted for copies. In addition to this, "free" software might not be commercial, so licenses prevent that, or at least discourage it.

> Q4: Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
* If I were to use or develop a project without a clear license, I could run into issues if the original creators did not want me to even run the software locally. Even worse, if I modify the code and make some innovative program that I monetize, the original developers might try suing for royalties. That could  create major chaos and frustration in court deciding on who is obligated to that money.

> Q5: Why the Web Beat Gopher
* The general difference between the development of the Web and Gopher is each team's willingness for their product to be "open". One idea presented was that the Gopher developers wanted their product to be "perfect" before release. Similarly, their system for feedback and criticism from users was not as well established as the RFCs by the developers of the Web. I would not blame Gopher for their design choices, as it was a new "environment" for them as well, so it just so happens that the Web chose the better conditions for software, and it took off.

> Q6: Linux and its GPL v2 license
* According to tldrlegal.com, the main aspects of the GNU General Public License v2.0 (GPL-2.0) include the ability to modify, distribute, and commericialize the original software. Those three tenants clearly line up with some of the goals of Linux. As mentioned [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/brief-history-of-linux) by Kathleen Juell in 2017, Linux was made to be distributed and adapted. The Linux community is built around multiple distributions for a variety of user needs. In contrast to other operating systems like Windows or macOS, there are not individual "versions" that developers can cater to other users. Another [article](https://www.linuxtrainingacademy.com/what-is-linux/) describes some of the different distributions and their uses. As mentioned earlier, the core of the GPL-2.0 license is the redistribution of software. Should the early developers of Linux had chosen a more restrictive or proprietary license, a popular operating system would be eliminated from the public realm. I feel that the GPL license was the best choice for Linux, and it seems to have allowed the Linux kernel to have great success.
